This is a fork of RC Slider.
Git repo: https://github.com/joshwcomeau/slider

I'm doing the wild thing of just copying the files into a `vendor` directory because trying to install the repo from Github wasn't working. I removed `lib` from the `.gitignore` (indeed, it's visible on Github: https://github.com/joshwcomeau/slider/tree/master/lib), but when I install the dependency, it lacks the `lib` directory, even when specifying the most recent commit SHA.

Rather than figure out what the heck this is about, I'm just moving these files into here.

I should probably just build my own slider from scratch. Or find an actually-accessible one!
