I recently worked on a refresh of the [Gatsby careers page](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/careers/). The design called for large bits of geometry sprinkled throughout the page, and I had an idea: what if the circles were more like bubbles, subtly undulating and wobbling?

<Demo
  id="wibbly-wobbly-circle-intro"
  initialValues={{
    intensity: 33,
  }}
  controls={(values, updateValue) => (
    <><SliderControl
      id="intensity"
      label="Intensity"
      min={0}
      max={100}
      value={values.intensity}
      updateValue={updateValue}
    />
        <SliderControl
      id="intensity"
      label="Intensity"
      min={0}
      max={100}
      value={values.intensity}
      updateValue={updateValue}
    /></>
  )}
>
  {({ intensity }) => {
    return (
      <WibblyWobblyCircle size={250} intensity={intensity * 0.0333} />
    )
  }}
</Demo>

I worked on a component like this years ago, which made a brief cameo in [a talk I gave about whimsy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2d9rw9RwyE).
