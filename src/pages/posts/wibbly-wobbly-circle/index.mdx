In 2014, Google unveiled Material Design. It featured all of the typical things you'd expect to find in a design system—UI widgets and color palettes and all that—but it brought one more thing that was totally new to me: a description of the physics used in the Material Design universe.

The core of Material Design is “material”, a 3-dimensional surface with rather unique properties. Designer Matías Duarte explained that “unlike real paper, our digital material can expand and reform intelligently. Material has physical surfaces and edges. Seams and shadows provide meaning about what you can touch.”

Essentially they took paper and ink—staples of our physical world—and reimagined them in a digital context. They provided a strict set of constraints for how “material” behaves, including some rather fun examples of what _not_ to do:

Regardless of how you feel about Material Design, there's a really cool idea here: our websites and apps can be thought of as a _universe_, and we get to decide how elements in that universe behave.

This idea was on my mind last year when I built a confett-rendering engine that gets blown around by the cursor:

<Demo
  id="confetti-geyser"
  noPadding
  initialValues={{
    concentration: 10,
  }}
  controls={(values, updateValue) => (
    <>
      <SliderControl id="concentration" label="Volume" min={1} max={40} value={values.concentration} updateValue={updateValue} />
    </>
  )}
>
  {props => {
    return (
      <ConfettiGeyserDemo {...props} />
    )
  }}
</Demo>



I recently worked on a refresh of the [Gatsby careers page](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/careers/) (we're hiring!). The design called for large bits of geometry sprinkled throughout the page, and I had an idea: what if the circles were soft, and gently wobbling as if floating in space?



<Demo
  includeResetButton
  id="wibbly-wobbly-circle-intro"
  initialValues={{
    intensity: 1,
    tension: 7,
    friction: 2,
  }}
  controls={(values, updateValue) => (
    <>
      <SliderControl
        id="intensity"
        label="Intensity"
        min={0}
        max={3.5}
        step={0.01}
        value={values.intensity}
        updateValue={updateValue}
      />
      <SliderControl
        id="tension"
        label="Tension"
        min={1}
        max={300}
        step={1}
        value={values.tension}
        updateValue={updateValue}
      />
      <SliderControl
        id="friction"
        label="Friction"
        min={0.1}
        max={20}
        step={0.1}
        value={values.friction}
        updateValue={updateValue}
      />
    </>
  )}
>
  {(props) => {
    return (
      <WibblyWobblyCircle size={250} {...props} />
    )
  }}
</Demo>

I worked on a component like this years ago, which made a brief cameo in [a talk I gave about whimsy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2d9rw9RwyE).
