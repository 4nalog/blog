      At React Europe in 2018, I delivered a talk all about how to make the
      internet more whimsical. This post serves as a collection for all relevent
      information/resources.

    <Paragraph>
      The version we use at Khan Academy uses a few optimizations to really make
      sure confetti runs smoothly on lower-end devices. To be clear, the
      difference between the two versions is pretty small; React's lifecycle is
      surprisingly lightweight on simple DOM trees like this. The "unoptimized"
      one still runs smoothly on a $150 chromebook.
