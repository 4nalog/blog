In my day-to-day life as a web developer, I generally treat CSS as a collection of 2D layers. Other than reordering them using z-index, I don't often _move_ things in 3D space.

And yet, for _years_ now, browsers have bundled in a surprisingly capable 3D CSS engine! Someone even built an experimental first-person shooter prototype using it ðŸ˜®

<VideoGif
  src={cssEngineSrc}
  caption={
    <>
      Believe it or not, this is just a collection of textured divs!
      {' '}
      <TextLink href="https://keithclark.co.uk/labs/css-fps/">
        View Live
      </TextLink>
    </>
  }
/>

Today I'd like to leverage that 3D engine to perform a neat trick: folding up a DOM node. This effect is a great way to add some whimsical charm to your web products.

Take a look at what I mean, by unfolding this [beautiful autumn photo](https://unsplash.com/photos/vrY49w_-Bmc) by Sandis Helvigs:

<SingleAxisDemo
  showNote={true}
  defaultValue={100}
  id="fold-intro"
>
  {percentage => (
    <Spring
      to={{percentage}}
      config={{
        tension: 60,
        friction: 13,
      }}
    >
      {interpolated => (
        <SingleFoldByRatio
          // The height of our node should be a fraction of the window height,
          // but no larger than 500px
          height={Math.min(
            Math.round(window.innerHeight * 0.6),
            500
          )}
          // Our width is just 2/3rds of our height.
          // Regrettably, because MDX doesn't support variables, I have to
          // duplicate all that stuff:
          width={
            Math.min(
              Math.round(window.innerHeight * 0.6 * 0.666),
              333
            )
          }
          percentage={interpolated.percentage}
        >
          <img src={autumnSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />
        </SingleFoldByRatio>
      )}
    </Spring>
  )}
</SingleAxisDemo>

This effect uses CSS <InlineCode>transform: rotateX</InlineCode> to rotate the bottom half upwards. There are a few CSS properties that we'll be leveraging:

## Perspective

<InlineCode>perspective</InlineCode> is a CSS property that controls the distance between the "camera" and the element. Elements much closer to the camera will have a much more dramatic effect when moving in 3D.

<SingleAxisDemo
  defaultValue={100}
  id="fold-perspective"
>
  {percentage => (
    <Spring
      to={{percentage}}
      config={{
        tension: 60,
        friction: 13,
      }}
    >
      {interpolated => (
        <SingleFoldByRatio
          // The height of our node should be a fraction of the window height,
          // but no larger than 500px
          height={Math.min(
            Math.round(window.innerHeight * 0.6),
            500
          )}
          // Our width is just 2/3rds of our height.
          // Regrettably, because MDX doesn't support variables, I have to
          // duplicate all that stuff:
          width={
            Math.min(
              Math.round(window.innerHeight * 0.6 * 0.666),
              333
            )
          }
          percentage={interpolated.percentage}
        >
          <img src={autumnSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />
        </SingleFoldByRatio>
      )}
    </Spring>
  )}
</SingleAxisDemo>
