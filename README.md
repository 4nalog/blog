# Josh Comeau's fun interactive blog thing

I started a blog! [Go look at it](https://www.joshwcomeau.com).

The code for this blog is kind of messy and problematic right now. My focus has been on getting it shipped. The biggest issue is that the homepage requires the entirety of every blog post; this will likely be fixed once I migrate to something like MDX.

So yeah, please don't use this codebase for inspiration! The code snippets used in the blog posts are a much more trustworthy source.
